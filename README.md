YOHORT
=======	

A project involving use of the yo api, javascript, html and css and jquery to create a webapp for sending a yo to subscribers 5 minutes before a course is about to take place.

Tested using jasmine.

note: This requires the mobile application 'yo' available on most modern mobile operating systems.

To use, simply send a yo to YOHORT in order to subscribe.
